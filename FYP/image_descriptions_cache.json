    "image_page7_img1.jpeg": "1. The image appears to be a diagram that represents a system or process with various components connected by arrows indicating flow or sequence. It includes boxes with labels and lines connecting them, which suggest it's a conceptual illustration or a workflow diagram rather than an architectural design or an engineering blueprint.\n2. The image could fit into the \"Methodology\" category, as it seems to describe the steps involved in a process or algorithm. It is not an introduction/background, results/findings, or key topics, as it lacks context and does not directly present data or findings from a study or experiment.\n3. The visible text in the image includes:\n   - \"self_assessment\"\n   - \"XC\"\n   - \"Boost\"\n   - \"Gender,\" \"Age,\" \"Healthy/Sick\"\n   - \"Data processing\"\n   - \"Cluster analysis\"\n4. The technical domain this image relates to is machine learning (ML)/artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, it appears to be related to a process that involves data collection, self-assessment, user demographic information (such as gender and age), and health status for some purpose. The subsequent steps of \"Boost\" and \"Cluster analysis\" suggest that the ML model may be involved in training an algorithm or improving performance through boosting techniques, followed by clustering the data into different groups.\n5. The diagram is likely a flowchart or process map for a machine learning model that uses self-assessment data to improve its accuracy, with demographic and health status information factored in for more targeted analysis or personalization of the ML model's outputs.",
